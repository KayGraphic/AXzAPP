CourtCounter-Axe Throw Scoreboard
For those of you who enjoy throwing axes competitively, here is the scoring rubric from the National Axe Throwing Federation:

Point Values The bullseye or black ring is worth 5 pts; The red ring is worth 3 pts; The blue ring is worth 1 pt; The green dots in the corner, or Clutch(TM*) are worth 7 pts. ​Clutch*
Players must declare that they are going to throw for Clutch before attempting, also referred to as 'Calling Clutch' or to 'Call Clutch'; Players can only throw for Clutch on the 5th and final throw of the round; An accidental clutch is not valid, even on a 5th throw, no call, no points; Once Clutch is called, only that point area is valid and all other point areas are worth zero: Meaning that if a player calls for Clutch but hits a bullseye, they receive no points. A Clutch call can be taken back after it is called but must be announced to their opponent and scorekeeper: If a Clutch call is denounced the target reverts to it's original values and the Clutch is worth zero​.
